Air Code and Coffe, application developed during the OmniStack week using Node.js, ReactJS and React Native. 

The idea behind this project is an app that allows companies to rent spaces for coworking, and users in general can make reservations of those places. 

The project includes:
-A back-end made with Node.js;
-A web page made with ReactJS;
-And a cross platform mobile interface using React Native. 


The name and idea are based on the original AirBnB (Air Bed and Breakfast) which offers a way for people to rent houses for staying.

Credits to Rocketseat for the app idea and assets used in their week long free course called OmniStack where they teach and show the development of this application from scratch.
